# How to use

Follow the instructions from the CLI to run the pipe server with the correct arguments and then call the server with:

```
bicep jsonrpc --pipe "Your pipe name here"
```

If you want the program to call the bicep json rpc by itself, you can specify its path with the argument ``--bicepExecutablePath "path to bicep executable"``
